Aerial Tracks:

  description:
  - You cause the air in the area to ripple where creatures have flown through it
    up to 1 day ago per caster level. These aerial ripples are tinged by glowing wisps,
    providing enough illumination to follow the tracks without penalties due to poor
    lighting. The area moves with you, allowing you to follow the tracks through the
    air over long distances provided you can fly or follow the route along the ground
    within range to read the aerial tracks. Other creatures can also follow the trail
    as long as they move with you. The base DC of Survival checks to track creatures
    through the air with this spell is the same as tracking creatures across soft
    ground.

    In addition, creatures that demand payment for their services reduce the payment
    by 20% for every 4 levels you possess (maximum 60% reduction). However, beings
    tortured by this spell quickly come to resent you, making them more likely to

    can still speak and read any languages it knows and perform basic tasks, but it
    loses all class abilities, feats, and skill ranks gained before being affected
    by amnesia. It retains its base attack bonus, saving throws bonuses, Combat Maneuver
    Bonus, Combat Maneuver Defense, total experience points, Hit Dice, and hit points.
    If the target gains a character level while suffering from amnesia, it can use
    any abilities gained by that class level normally. If the class level it gained
    was from a class in which it already has levels, it gains the abilities of a 1st-level
    character of that class, even though it is technically of a higher level in that

  components: V, S, M (gold dust worth 25 gp)
  description:
  - An arcane lock spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks it. You
    can freely pass your own arcane lock without affecting it. If the locked object
    has a lock, the DC to open that lock increases by 10 while it remains attached
    to the object. If the object does not have a lock, this spell creates one that
    can only be opened with a DC 20 Disable Device skill check. A door or object secured
    with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful dispel
    magic or knock spell. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected
    by this spell. A knock spell does not remove an arcane lock; it only suppresses
    the effect for 10 minutes.

    AC bonus for the purpose of this spell. This enhancement bonus stacks with itself,
    but not with an existing enhancement bonus, to a maximum enhancement bonus of
    +5. This spell has no effect while underwater or in environments that lack air.

  - If you take electricity damage while this spell is active, some of the energy
    is stored on your skin, as with holding the charge on a touch spell. You can release
    this stored electricity by making a melee touch attack. You gain a +3 bonus on
    the attack roll if your opponent is wearing metal armor, is carrying a metal weapon,
    or is made of metal. The target of your touch attack is dealt electricity damage
    equal to half the amount of electricity damage you took after you cast this spell
    (for example, if you saved for half damage against a lightning bolt and took only
    15 points of electricity damage, your next touch attack deals 7 points of electricity
    damage). This spell is discharged once you hit with a melee touch attack to deliver
    its damage. If you take electricity damage multiple times while this spell is
    active, use the largest amount of electricity damage you took to determine your
    touch attack damage.

    does not harm the item, and it does not get hot enough or last long enough to

    \ of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active. When you throw\

    \ of a solid wall of force. The prison is as large as the splash area of the bomb\
    \ that you threw, and traps any creature that is entirely inside the area. Creatures\

    \ radius is too big to fit inside, in which case the effect automatically fails.\
    \ Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide means for escape, but\
    \ the force walls extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. Like\
    \ a wall of force, the cage created by the caging bomb admixture resists dispel\

    \ cage can be damaged by spells as normal, except for disintegrate, which automatically\
    \ destroys the cage. The walls of this cage can be damaged by weapons and supernatural\
    \ abilities, but the cage has a hardness of 20 and a number of hit points equal\
    \ to 20 per alchemist level. Contact with a sphere of annihilation or a rod of\
    \ cancellation instantly destroys this cage. When using caging bomb admixture,\
    \ an alchemist can only have one cage in effect at a time. If the alchemist throws\
    \ another bomb during the duration of caging bomb admixture, any other cage created\
    \ by the earlier admixture ends, and a new one is created. When the duration of\

    a creature that looks and fights just like a treant. The staff-treant defends
    you and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it
    cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced
    to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise,
    the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when
    the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of
    the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any
    wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.

    obstacles. The beanstalk provides numerous hand- and footholds; its climb DC 5.
    The beanstalk can support up to 200 pounds plus 50 pounds per caster level, or
    double that amount if anchored on its upper end. If it anchors itself to a sturdy
    mobile object (such as a ship or a siege engine), breaking the object free requires

  description:

    When the target is within 30 feet of a trigger and is aware of the trigger, it
    gains the sickened condition and feels an urge to leave. A successful Will save
    negates the urge to leave, but the sickened condition persists as long as the
    target is within 30 feet of a trigger and aware of it. Example triggers include
    beggars, filthy clothing, diseased creatures, the king, blood, spiders, rats,

    the glove can move up to its speed and perform a task in the same action. You
    can attempt Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks using the glove, though
    attempting these checks at a distance increases the normal skill check DCs by
    5, or by 20 if you do not have line of sight to the object you are manipulating.
    The glove can also lift or drag objects using your caster level as your Strength
    score. The glove cannot wield weapons or make attacks effectively while this spell
    is in effect. If you cast this spell on a magical glove, its innate magic is suppressed
    for the duration of the spell.

    \ The creature must take the same type of actions in the same order (for example,\
    \ making a full attack, casting a specific spell, withdrawing, attempting a bull\
    \ rush combat maneuver, or activating a magic item) and must act against the same\

    \ from repeating an action, such as if the target of its attack is dead or the\

    blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light is too dim to
    have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light.

  area: null
  casting_time: 1 standard action
  components: V, S, M (a copper piece or silver piece)
  description:
  - You can temporarily make copper or silver seem to be an equivalent amount of gold.
    The spell affects 1 gp/level worth of material (thus, at 3rd level, the spell
    affects up to 300 copper pieces, 30 silver pieces, or a copper or silver item
    worth no more than 3 gp). Coins increase in value as normal for the new type of
    coinage. For items other than coins, some of the value of the item comes from
    its craftsmanship, regardless of the metal used, so the value of the item seems
    to be 5 times (for silver items) or 50 times (for copper items) its true value.
    Thus, a copper candlestick originally worth 5 cp transformed by this spell appears
    to be worth 250 cp, or 2 gp and 5 sp. A successful DC 25 Appraise check automatically
    detects the true nature of the coins or items. Creatures inspecting or interacting
    with the coins or items can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion.

  description:
  - You create a hook of force that strikes the target and drags you to a space adjacent
    to it. Make a ranged touch attack against the target; if the touch attack succeeds,
    the target takes 1 point of force damage per caster level. Whether or not the
    touch attack hits, the force hook drags you in a straight line to a square adjacent
    to the target. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. The pulling
    hook keeps you from falling as part of this movement; therefore you can use it
    to cross a pit or chasm, or reach a higher or lower elevation. If the line of
    effect from you to the target passes through an area that is too small to fit
    your body (such as a portcullis or arrow slit), the hook pulls you to that location
    and you take damage as if you had fallen the distance from your starting point
    to that location. If you are restrained, such as being chained to a wall, the
    hook pulls you to the maximum extent of your restraints but does not break the
    restraints.

    \ shadowstuff. You link the intangible item to the target\u2019s flesh by making\
    \ a brand shaped like the item on the target\u2019s skin. The intangible item\
    \ merges with the target\u2019s flesh and is contained within the target\u2019\
    s body, moving with the target wherever it goes. The creature can retrieve the\
    \ item or reabsorb it as a full-round action, and can do so as many times as it\
    \ wants. When worn or wielded by the target, the item regains its solidity and\
    \ functions normally, though the target can\u2019t drop or remove the item (other\
    \ than by using the full-round action), nor can it be disarmed or stolen. If the\
    \ item is destroyed, the spell ends. If the ghost brand spell is dispelled while\
    \ the object is inside the target\u2019s body, the object bursts out of the target\u2019\
    s flesh, dealing 3d6 points of piercing and slashing damage to the target that\

    harm creatures that it grapples. Directing the spell to a new target is a move

    deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage if
    fired from a gravity bow (see table on this page for associated increase/decrease
    in damage due to size change). Only you can benefit from this spell. If anyone
    else uses your bow to make an attack the arrows deal damage as normal for their

    s existence to a canny observer who notices fish disappearing into the bubble\

    throw, it takes 4d6 + your Charisma modifier (in the case of oracles) or Wisdom
    modifier (in the case of clerics) electricity damage. It takes no damage on a
    successful saving throw. You can dismiss this spell as an immediate action when
    its subject confirms a critical hit to negate the critical hit and daze the creature
    for 1 round. The attack still hits its target and deals normal damage. The effects
    of the daze occur after the attack.

    knock opens up to two means of closure. This spell opens secret doors, as well
    as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or
    chains (provided they serve to hold something shut). If used to open an arcane
    locked door, the spell does not remove the arcane lock but simply suspends its
    functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself
    or become stuck again on its own. Knock does not raise barred gates or similar
    impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like.
    The effect is limited by the area. Each casting can undo as many as two means
    of preventing access.

    If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the
    casting time is only 1d4 x 10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on
    the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting
    lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information
    to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore
    result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and
    the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more
    detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).

    body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the
    receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range
    and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of
    effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near
    as anyone can tell, dead.

    are flanking you, you gain a +2 bonus on your attack roll (and confirmation attack
    roll, see below). If you hit both enemies, you can deal half damage to each. Hitting
    only one opponent allows you to deal that opponent normal damage for your attack.
    On a critical threat, you can make only one attack roll to confirm the critical
    hit against both opponents. If you confirm against both, you deal half your critical
    hit damage to each. Your hit is a normal hit rather than a critical if you confirm
    against only one opponent. If you fail to use the effect before the end of your
    next turn, the spell ends.

  description:
  - "You inscribe a rune on the target object. The rune remains dormant until the\
    \ object finds its way into the hands of a spellcaster, at which point the rune\
    \ steals one of that creature\u2019s spells and passes the knowledge back to you.\
    \ The stolen spell is selected randomly. An object inscribed with this rune is\
    \ affected as though by the spell magic aura. Additionally, if a creature in possession\
    \ of the object casts a spell that appears on your spell list, there is a 10%\
    \ chance that the mnemonic siphon absorbs that spell, causing it to fail as though\
    \ it had been successfully countered. Whenever the mnemonic siphon absorbs a spell\
    \ in this fashion, it causes the knowledge of the absorbed spell to appear directly\
    \ in your mind. You can use this knowledge to prepare the spell if you have an\
    \ unused spell slot capable of casting it. You can also use the knowledge to write\
    \ the spell into a spellbook or teach it to your familiar. This knowledge remains\
    \ in your mind for 24 hours, after which time it is lost. The mnemonic siphon\
    \ is capable of absorbing up to 1 spell per 2 caster levels you have before being\
    \ discharged. If you are not capable of learning a stolen spell normally, the\
    \ knowledge is useless to you."

    an associated damage type (see the table below). Any creature that hits you with

    damage plus 1 point per caster level you have (maximum +20) of a type corresponding
    to the essence trait you chose. In addition, you take only half damage from attacks
    or effects of the associated damage type, and if such an attack or effect allows
    a saving throw for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.

Prestidigitation:

  description:
  - Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice.
    Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects
    for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation
    can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot
    cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
    It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. Prestidigitation
    can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created
    by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as
    tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, prestidigitation lacks the power
    to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just
    moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.

    If the caster level check to break the hostile effect succeeds, you give voice
    to your scream and the spell takes effect normally; if not, this spell fails without
    further effect. You can cast this spell even when paralyzed or unable to speak
    because of an enchantment effect, but not in an area of silence, if you are unable
    to speak for reasons other than enchantments or paralysis (for example, if you

    all non-magical fires in its area. The spell also dispels any fire spells in its
    area, though you must succeed on a dispel check (1d20 +1 per caster level, maximum
    +15) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the
    caster level of the fire spell.

    plane of existence using a gate or similar portal, but the caster loses contact
    with the sensor should this occur. The enhanced ioun stone has AC 24, 10 hp, hardness
    5, fly speed 30 (perfect), and a +16 Stealth bonus. The stone does not provide
    you with its normal benefits while you are using it as a scrying sensor.

    make gestures, or engage in whatever other method speakers of the language use
    to communicate with each other in order to actually converse. If the target lacks
    the mental capacity to grasp an actual language, it still gains enough knowledge
    to respond to and carry out even extremely complex commands or suggestions coached
    in the language (whether written or spoken). However, since this spell does not
    endow the target with greater reasoning capacity, merely a temporarily enhanced

    take care to remove any ambiguity or guesswork.

    may designate a target 5-foot-square within range and launch a pyrotechnic in
    that direction. The pyrotechnic takes a zigzag path from you to that square, always
    missing creatures and objects in its path, and detonates in that square with a
    bang and a colorful burst of fire and light. Creatures in the target square take
    1d4 points of fire damage and are dazzled for 1 round (Reflex half, a successful
    save negates the dazzled condition). Normally when this spell is used as part
    of a festival, the chosen target is high in the sky to increase visibility and
    protect observers.

Snare:
  area: null
  casting_time: 3 rounds
  components: V, S, DF
  description:
  - This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare
    can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast snare upon
    it, the cord-like object blends with its surroundings (DC 23 Perception check
    for a character with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the snare
    is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature
    stepping inside the circle. If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can
    be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend, straightening when the loop
    is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting
    it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available,
    the cord-like object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing
    it to be entangled.

  components: ': V, S, M (powdered peas and an animal hoof)'
  description:
  - This spell functions like fog cloud, but in addition to obscuring sight, the solid
    fog is so thick that it impedes movement. Creatures moving through a solid fog
    move at half their normal speed and take a -2 penalty on all melee attack and
    melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except
    for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into solid fog is
    slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling
    damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in solid fog. Solid
    fog, and effects that work like solid fog, do not stack with each other in terms
    of slowed movement and attack penalties.

Solid Note:
  area: null
  casting_time: 1 standard action
  components: V
  description:
  - You give temporary physical form to a single musical note and can hang it, suspended,
    wherever you wish within range, allowing you to use it as hook, pulley, door blocker,
    or anything else your imagination desires. The exact appearance of the solid note
    depends on your melody. You can make it spiked or smooth, simple or convoluted,
    and with any color pattern you wish, however, it always has a size approximately
    equal to that of your outstretched hand. Once created, the solid note resists
    all attempts to move it but instantly disappears if enough force or weight is
    brought to bear against it. The note has an effective Strength equal to 10 + your
    caster level. It cannot hold more weight than the equivalent of a heavy load for
    its Strength without disappearing. Any creature that wins an opposed Strength
    check against the note (by pushing open a door which the note is holding shut
    for example) also causes it to disappear. The note can never deal actual harm
    to a creature and disappears if successfully attacked (AC 10 + your Charisma modifier)
    or overcome with a combat maneuver such as bull rush (CMD 2 + your base attack
    bonus + your Charisma modifier). Any creature obstructed by the solid note simply
    fails to budge it and loses that action for the round.

    as normal.) For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell of 4th level
    or lower that you cast can be delivered by the spectral hand. The spell gives
    you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts
    normally as an attack. The hand always strikes from your direction. The hand cannot
    flank targets like a creature can. After it delivers a spell, or if it goes beyond

    creatures or objects as a full-round action, you can learn its direction and relative
    distance from your location, provided that it is on the same plane. In the case
    of a creature, you can also learn the state of its emotion or health aura as a
    full-round action. In the case of an object, you can also get a sense of how damaged
    it is, similar to reading the health aura of a creature, or, in the case of a
    magic item that must be activated, you can learn when it was last activated (a
    full-round action in either case).

  description:
  - A weapon made of force appears and attacks foes at a distance, as you direct it,
    dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, + 1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5
    at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or
    a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and
    has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form.
    It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the
    spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your
    base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent
    rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell,
    not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction.
    As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the reduction in
    damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction.
    It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat
    actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if
    it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns
    to you and hovers.

    To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a detect magic
    spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you can observe
    all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your
    hit points and save bonuses remain unaffected. You gain a +10 natural armor bonus

  description:
  - When a creature attempts to touch you with an attack (such as a touch attack,
    an unarmed strike, an attack with a natural weapon, or a grapple), it feels a
    field of force blocking its way. It can choose to abandon the attempt, losing
    its action, or to push through the ward. If it pushes through, you can trigger
    a wave of force against that creature. This discharges the spell, deals 1d4 points
    of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d4), and pushes the creature back
    5 feet. If the creature cannot be pushed back 5 feet (if a solid surface is directly
    behind it, for example), it takes 2d4 additional points of force damage. A successful
    Fortitude saving throw halves the total amount of force damage the creature takes.

    to this spell. This allows all such eligible creatures to perceive the true nature
    of the affected area instead of its illusory appearance. Creatures without this

    absolutely nothing of interest or worth to them. Unless they have reason for suspicion,

  description:
  - This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending
    on the version selected. A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical
    objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any
    creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to
    disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell
    automatically fails. Fire can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to

Wreath of Blades:
  area: 5-foot-radius emanation centered on you
  casting_time: 1 standard action
  components: V, S, F (four mithral daggers, each worth at least 502 gp each)
  description:
  - The daggers serving as focus of this spell take on a deadly sharpness as they
    animate and spin around you, creating a 5-foot-radius emanation of spinning mithral
    blades that moves with you. Any creature that starts its turn within the area
    of the spinning blades takes 1d4 points of damage for every two caster levels
    (maximum 10d4 at 20th level) and the damage bypasses DR/silver. Furthermore, the
    daggers ward off some attacks, in a way similar to the warding weapon spell. While
    subject to this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells,
    even from creatures with the Disruptive feat. Creatures with the Spellbreaker
    feat can easily bypass this defensive property, though they still take damage
    from the spell. Your casting (even failing to cast defensively) still provokes
    attacks of opportunity from creatures with that feat. Lastly, the blades that
    serve as the focus for this spell can be enchanted for greater effect. When all
    of the blades share the same enhancement bonus and special weapon qualities, a
    creature that is damaged by this spell is also treated as if hit by one of these
    weapons. For example, if a 12th-level magus casts this spell using four +1 frost
    mithral daggers as focus, the damage dealt by the blades would be 6d4+1 plus 1d6
    cold damage, as long as the daggers were commanded to be sheathed in ice. No matter
    the modifications made to the focus weapons, they must always be mithral daggers.
    No other type of weapons can serve as a focus for this spell.
