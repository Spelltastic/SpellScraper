  description:
  - Abeyance suppresses the effects of a single curse on a creature. It does not restore
    any damage or drain that might have been caused by the curse. Abeyance cannot
    suppress curses that cannot be removed by remove curse, but it can suppress curses
    such as lycanthropy that require remove curse along with additional measures.
    An individual curse can be suppressed only once by abeyance, even if cast by a
    different caster.
